## Scaling Challenges and Project Repos set up!


### In Part 1 of this lab, you will design/implement/test as many strategies as you can to continue to scale your Scruncher!

 1. You want to provide a list of the top 10 trending links, how do you do it?
 2. A market research firm wants to pay you big bucks for a daily report with usage statistics, how do you do it?
 3. Users are complaining they're receiving links to known malware and phishing websites, what do you do?
 4. Users are asking for the ability to share links with only people they approve, how can you give it to them?

In addition to this, think of another scaling challenge and pose for the rest to the class (and Cliff and Erik) to solve!
Post this as a reply to the "My Scaling Challenge!" issue before Monday March 30th!

### In Part 2, make sure you Project 2 repo is set up.

Feel free to share it under the "My Project 2" issue before the end of lab.  For many of you, you are continuing to build on Project 1, so CLEARLY identify the vast improvements you have introduced relative to that early release of your system! :)
