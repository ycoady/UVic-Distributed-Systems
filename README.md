### CSC 462/562 Spring 2015!

Welcome to our extravaganza in building cool systems that involve multiple computational devices, CSC 462/562 Distributed Computing.  This course is for fearless 4th year [undergrads](http://courses.seng.uvic.ca/courses/2015/spring/csc/462) and [grads](http://courses.seng.uvic.ca/courses/2015/spring/csc/562).
